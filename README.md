# DesktopWebApps
This repository holds the code for a simple electron app which acts like a desktop holder for permenent web tabs that users may like to use. 

I have built the installer for windows and published it in the repository releases section. If you want to use it on mac or linux however, you will need to pull the repository and build the installer locally. Feel free to submit a PR with the mac and linux installers. 

Tips:
Double clicking a tab lets you rename it to whatever you like
Drag tabs to rearrange them
